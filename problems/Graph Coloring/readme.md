# Graph Coloring

### Description

Assing colors to nodes of a graph so that no two adjacent nodes recieve the same color.


### Optimal number of colors

The number of optimal colors (minimun colors needed) is the number of nodes of the biggest complete subgraph (aka [Clique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)), this known as the [Clique_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem)

> ### Clique or Complete subgraph
> When are the nodes are adjacent to each other.



### Special Case: Map coloring (4 color theorem)

Color a map so that no two adjacent territories recieve the same color. The maximun colors needed are 4 bocause of the [4 Color Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem):
- Every map can be colores with just 4 colors
- Proven by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken
- First major theroem proven with a computer
